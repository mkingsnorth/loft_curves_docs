If you encounter any warnings (seen in red in the screenshot here) or are finding some of the curves do not align, you can enable Debug Mode in the modifier settings (shown in green). 

This will add extra visual guides to help you identify and fix any issues. It will:

* Turn the surface into a wireframe to see more clearly.
* Show any misaligned guide curves as a thickened cylinder with a red material.

    Make sure you are in either *Solid* or *Material Preview* view modes to see the debug visualisations.
