Loft Curves
=======================================

---------------------------------
What is Loft Curves?
---------------------------------

`Loft Curves <https://blendermarket.com/products/loft-curves/?ref=361>`_ is a Blender add-on that turns sets of curves into editable surfaces which are just like any other Blender object.  It wraps a robust Geometry Nodes core inside a modifier with a toolset for curve‑driven modelling, so you can block out forms with guides and profiles, tweak interactively, and apply the modifier to export or continue modelling. 

With live updates, guide curves, and sweep controls, it gives you an intuitive way to design complex forms directly from your curves, without leaving Blender.

* **Use cases**: product shells, hulls, wings, footwear lasts, concept surfaces, architectural pieces, sci‑fi paneling, hard‑surface panels, and more.
* **Designed for**: modelers, concept artists, tech artists, and anyone who prefers shaping with curves.

---------------------------------
Key Features
---------------------------------

* **Turn Curves into Surfaces**: 
  
   Instantly transform sets of profile curves into clean, editable Blender objects.

* **Live Editing**: 

   Adjust curves in Edit Mode and see your loft update in real time.

* **Guide Curve Control**: 

   Add guide curves snapped to profiles to fine-tune the surface flow.

* **Supports Open & Closed Curves**:
